## What is machine learning?

Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly learned.
Tom Mitchell says, a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
